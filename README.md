## About

This project is required for completion of the Front End Nanodegree Developer program
at [Udacity](udacity.com). The starting code was cloned from [GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game.git)

## Instructions

To play, click or touch a card. This will reveal a character. Touch another card to reveal another
character. If the characters match, their background color will change and they will stay revealed.
If the characters don't match, then touching another unrevealed card will hide them, leaving only
the third card revealed. Each click or touch is a move. When all matches are found, a message
will appear with your number of moves, the seconds to complete the game, and a star rating. For 30
or fewer moves, the rating is three stars; for 31 to 34 moves, two stars; and more than 34 moves, one star.
